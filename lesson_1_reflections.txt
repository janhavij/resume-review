Lesson 1: 
git -> version control system
github -> code sharing and collaboration platform. 

Tools for automatically comparing files: 
In windows ->  FC (file compare)
in Mac and Linus -> Diff (difference)

command:
diff -u a.txt b.txt

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
i could focus on the differences than similarities. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
if i can always revert back to working copy of the code and walk from there. 


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
